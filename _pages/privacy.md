## Privacy policy

This site may use:

- **Cookies** for basic functionality (e.g. preferences).
- **Analytics** (e.g. Google Analytics) if enabled in configuration—see your IP and usage data.
- **Third-party content** (e.g. Disqus comments, ads) when those features are turned on.

We do not sell your data. Check `_config.yml` to see which integrations (Disqus, Google Analytics, ads) are enabled and review those services’ privacy policies.
